    <p>To be precise, it happened in somewhere between a picosecond and a second. If you had tried to say the words “Sarglop’s Ramen Noodles” in the time it took to happen, it would be over before you finished taking the little breath that humans take before they start speaking. Not even the “s” from “Sarglop’s” would be heard, and anyone wondering what you were going to say would be left with no choice but to guess. Even if, by some cosmic coincidence, they guessed that you had been about to say the name of a noodle, they would have almost no chance of knowing which one, and would probably guess a less thick and less slurpy noodle than Sarglop’s.</p>
